# Blog-API

- Create a blog fullstack blog application. Have a front end application for viewing and
  editing posts. Let people read and comment on posts. Basically the blog should make it 
  so only you, imagine like the 'guardian' or 'the atlantic'. So I guess there should 
  be a section that allows users. Some inspirations to take from that are similar 
  are reddit, dogonews, ign, or something similar. It just has to involve posts, authors, comments,
  etcetera. Just takes things one at a time.



# Models:
- Posts should have an author, title, description, content. Also 
  each post should have the comments associated with that post.
  A timestamp as well to when it was first published.
  Finally we should be able to toggle in our database whether or 
  not a post is designated as published (visible) or unpublished.
